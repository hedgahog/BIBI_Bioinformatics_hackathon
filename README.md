# BIBI_Bioinformatics_hackathon
Overview:
We built a simple streamlit interface that will accept any rs id. Our Gemini AI agent uses data from NCBI and Ensembl to generate an insightful summary. This summary is catered towards bioinformaticians and scientists.


Requirements:
streamlit
python (3.9-3.13 supports streamlit)

Installation:
Install streamlit in conda:
conda install streamlit

Run the interface code:
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
