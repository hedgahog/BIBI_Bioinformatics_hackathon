# BIBI_Bioinformatics_hackathon
Prompt:

Given a gene symbol or SNP ID, your AI agent should autonomously collect relevant information from at least one public bioinformatics source and generate a concise, structured “insight summary” (e.g., functional role, disease association, or known variants) that could assist a researcher or clinician. A minimal user interface is required for the demo.
